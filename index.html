              "On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to
              represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but
              he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches,
              though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[41] A year
              later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar
              made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and
              scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian
              to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[54] He was
              selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar
              after Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's
              cricket practice nets,[27] where the Indian team had come to play
              against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring
              a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also
              Indian domestic tournaments.[55] Tendulkar finished the 1988–89
              Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583
              runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer
              overall.[56] In both 1988 and 1999, Tendulkar was picked for a
              young Indian team to tour England under the Star Cricket Club
              banner.[57] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which Bombay
              narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was key to
              giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355
              from only 70 overs on the final day.[58] At the start of the
              1989–90 season, while playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored
              an unbeaten century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi.[59] In
              the final of 1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar, captain of Bombay,
              scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab.[60] In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he
              captained Mumbai against Rest of India.[60] His first double
              century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting
              Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[27][61] He is
              the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his
              domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep
              Trophies).[62] Another double century was an innings of 233*
              against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy,
              which he regards as one of the best innings of his
              career."Tendulkar has received several awards from the government
              of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997),
              the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[10][11]
              After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime
              Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat
              Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He was the first
              sportsperson to receive the reward, and as of 2021, he is the
              youngest recipient and was the first sportsperson to receive the
              award.[14][15] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya
              Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[16] In 2010,
              Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential
              people in the world.[17] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield
              Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International
              Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.[18] Having retired from ODI cricket
              in 2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in November
              2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[21] Tendulkar played 664
              international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[22]
              In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to
              mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he
              was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era,
              along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[23] In 2019,
              he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[24]
